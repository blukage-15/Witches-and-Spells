She's a nasty one.\nShe appears out of nowhere and descends you from the current position. Not only that you also lose your health after her attack. \nBut don't worry but I've your back. I've put some potions in the forest.....\nHmmmm....  Actually I've lost them ðŸ˜… , but you can use them. \nThere are 3 potions HEAL, POWER, TELEPORTATION.\nThe heal potion give you a spell to regenerate your health. That means +2 health and you can't go beyond max. \nPower potion give you the ability to not descend and goto one place further than witch but you will still lose you health. This spell activates automatically when you encounter the witch. \nThe teleportation potion gives you the spell to move 3 spaces from the current space. \nOH! Also I forgot there is also some poison. They decrease your health by one means -1 health. You could avoid it but they all look the same ðŸ˜….\n You can only use the spells before rolling the dice and only once. If you use the spell then the dice will roll automatically. \nAlso only player can get out of the forest? The looser will die. \nOkay then! bye have a great time.")
